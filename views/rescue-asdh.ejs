         <p class="hero-subtitle"> <br>
            The purpose of the study is to perform a multi-centre, pragmatic, parallel group randomised trial in order to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of decompressive craniectomy versus craniotomy for the management of adult head-injured patients undergoing evacuation of an acute subdural haematoma (ASDH).<br><br>
            The primary objective of the trial is to detect an 8% absolute difference in the rate of favourable outcome at 1 year between decompressive craniectomy (43%) and craniotomy (35%) with a power of 90% and a 2-sided significance of 5%. This corresponds to an 8% treatment effect.<br><br>
            There is currently no high-quality evidence guiding surgeons as to which operation they should be offering as first line treatment to patients with ASDH. The results of a high-quality study will be used to inform future NICE head injury guidelines and the practice of neurosurgeons in the NHS and worldwide.<br><br>
            The two health technologies we wish to assess are the two most widely used surgical techniques for the evacuation of an ASDH: craniotomy and decompressive craniectomy (DC). The difference between these 2 procedures is that a bone flap is left out prior to closing the skin in the DC. The advantage of a DC is that it is effective in controlling brain swelling which is often a problem in the days after the operation. When the swelling goes down, the patient has another operation to reconstruct the skull (cranioplasty). The advantage of a craniotomy is that the patient will not need a later operation to rebuild the skull. However, it may fail to control brain swelling in some patients.
<br><br>
Five-year pilot data from a NHS neurosurgical unit (Cambridge) show that 56% of patients with ASDH were treated with a DC [2]. In this retrospective cohort comparison study, 91 patients had an operation for an ASDH. The standardised morbidity ratio was lower in individuals who received DC (0.75; 95% CI 0.51–1.07) than in those treated with a craniotomy (0.90; 95% CI 0.57–1.35). Although the standardised morbidity ratio 95% confidence intervals overlap, this study lends support to the hypothesis that DC may lead to better functional outcomes in comparison to craniotomy for adult head-injured patients with ASDH.
